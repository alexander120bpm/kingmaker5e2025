Yeah, you can cross-write a story now.
Oh my god.
Hello, Skynet.
Yeah.
I, for one, welcome our new robot.
Hello, Rock.
We were watching the transcription as a kid
and it messed up so much stuff.
It was like, I cast potato.
Yup.
Nice.
But then we put the transcription into Chat2Petit
and it produced this summary and it was like,
this is actually really good, except
we were trying to get the services of a cleric
and so it thinks that we have a new member
of our party called Claire Rick.
Oh, I love her.
She's so fucking cool.
So if I ever have to create a cleric,
that's going to be the name that I choose.
Okay.
Can somebody tell me the background?
Is it plus two plus one plus one?
Plus two plus one or
one one one.
Say that again.
Plus two and a plus one or
one one one.
I only have room for one feeling
in my life right now.
Spike.
Thank you.
The default.
Donnie, who are you?
Where are you from? What's your favorite color?
I'm Donnie.
I'm from Planet Earth.
My favorite color is
I don't know, green.
Or red.
I can't tell the difference.
I was going to say, I was like,
can you see that one?
I can see green and red.
They're just not always
accurate.
That one man with the dogs
in the car, punch it, it's gray.
Pete, what type of weapon would you like to use?
A fake one?
A port of Kermie?
For a barbarian.
You could use a
club that's great.
A great club?
Or a mediocre club?
I'll take whatever you give me
and I'll make it into magic.
I don't have a mini.
I'm a furbolg.
We do have a furbolg mini.
You better look like me.
I'm a furbolg.
It's like a
fey giant.
But they're like
70 feet tall.
Giant kin.
But they're like
very big.
Like mushrooms.
Oh, I found it, actually.
Yes, they did.
That's our furbolg.
And if you lose it, that's big
because you have three more.
Acceptable.
Pete, would you rather do slashing damage
or bludgeoning damage?
I would rather do
probably
slashing damage.
I would rather do
probably
go ahead and look through
it.
I neglected
the blue
gray color.
There's my octopus.
What's your class
again?
My last character was also blue.
I didn't know they were blue before it.
I can't wait to see
what they look like.
Okay.
Problem is, I can't see
details with my glasses on.
Me neither.
Why do I
even have them? Oh, I know, because
otherwise I'd be blind.
My
definitely gotten a lot worse
with the last character.
Do you think this is all going to get summarized as
nonsense?
This guy's got horns.
Nonsense
This guy's got horns.
Sure, for now.
We'll see. We'll see how
it shapes out.
And then,
quick question.
Does it also record
the music?
The words from songs?
You know, I didn't think about that
because the music we were playing last night
didn't have words in it.
Or
or
It's Raining Men
or
As a theme song for our
burdening empire.
Which is the same
thing, really.
From a different perspective.
Do you need a naked barbarian?
Wait, can you stop?
He's got a loincloth.
You don't have to have clothes if you don't want them.
I mean, you can have a loincloth.
You have to play as your
character.
Oh, cool. Let's go get some armor.
Strip him down, buddy.
Nice.
Or you could be this dude.
Our last character was a
rune knight.
He turned into a giant.
So he started off as a regular dude
and then
when he went to giant
they replaced him
with a whole new name.
Here.
Perfect.
It's still doing its thing.
Alright, how do we get him up?
Oh, wow.
Nice, he's about 40.
Cue! What?
You stop that right now.
Whatever bullshit you're on.
Stop it.
I want a light and mine's about 14 but I also have a shield.
This one.
Somebody got tea on the stove or something?
Looks like someone had tea on the brain.
Okay, welcome.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Well, you know
it's been a while.
Ta-da!
Did you find one?
I'm going to use this one for now.
Okay.
Even though I don't have two axes.
Yeah, I'm not seeing
anything else with
horns.
Cool.
And I have a prehensile tail.
Pointy on the end.
Nice.
Are we ready? Are we mostly ready?
Kristy, can you
grab the pages that I just put on the
printer? Yes.
Hmm, we don't know the lyrics
for this one.
Okay.
No, I'm scared.
We might have to...
We took them out of the table.
And I have them on glasses
because I came out.
But I'm wondering
if we...
There's really tight for this maybe.
Well, I
just have to get close to things.
You can put a T.
Right there.
What we need to do is just convert
the entire upstairs into the gaming
floor.
Yes.
But the children aren't willing to give it up just yet.
Okay, who's in charge here?
Who's paying the mortgage? Are they?
I don't think so.
No, we...
Yeah.
What we should do is put some pulleys
and lift it up.
And lower it back down.
Sweet plate.
I'm actually curious now. I want to
look at getting a new TV at this point
because you know the brand new ones are so much
better.
That one is so much brighter
and so much thinner.
These old ones just... I don't even know why
we even bought them. You could get a projector
and do like an acrylic
cutout that goes in the center and it just
projects onto the acrylic.
Yeah, and my only concern with
projectors is are they going to be bright enough?
And then it's like, okay,
I don't want to fix it to the ceiling.
So yeah, each
modality has its own issues.
Alright.
Yep, that's the only thing that's
important in this thing.
You have come here to the
Aldori Manor in the city of
Restov in the country of Brevoy.
Because you have answered the call
of one Lady Jumandi and her
call for heroes.
She has made known
that she is trying to
civilize these
stolen lands and needs
adventurers to help accomplish
that task.
So she has invited you to her
manor to sort of discuss those and
establish a charter for you
to have the rights
to explore this new land
and protect it
against
the bandits that have been fighting it
and the many
monsters that might be running deeper
into the wilderness that
civilized people never even venture into.
There will also be some
internal forces.
Foreign and domestic
threats.
There's no drought.
There's no drought.
We don't necessarily have to worry about
the domestic
threats.
They're good people.
So as you come to this land
you have been hearing rumors
of a new god
that has been making manifest in the world.
A previously
not
what am I trying to say?
A role among the gods that was not
previously taken has now been
taken by a new god.
Known in his mortal
life as Dorn.
We don't
quite have an established name for what he is
known in his celestial form
being non-judgmental.
But yes, a new constellation has appeared
in the sky, one of a croc.
Brigham Dorn.
Dorn Smith Jr.
Instead of Brigham Dorn University.
This is why
we did not invite my brother Andrew
to join. He was like, oh you're starting a new
campaign? Maybe I could come.
And Christie kind of pointed it out
right away.
You might relax a little
bit.
Alright.
So you stand. Maybe not that much.
I could be the bridge.
So you stand upon
a cobblestone path
following up
to an impressive hilltop manner.
You stand
near some
regal oak trees and well-manning your hedges.
And you've been
sort of following your way along this path.
You pass some
barracks, the stables,
some batch-root cottages
where the many servants and retainers
of the manor live.
And you can see sort of
in the sky that the sky is
darkening from
what looks like coming rain clouds.
And it looks like there might be a storm
a coming.
So you are
on this path. And as
you gather, you see
this view as well as a number
of other folk
who look to be of the adventuring sort.
Much more rough and tumble. Some seem to be
well-supplied
and organized. And others
seem to be just individuals
sort of trying to find a group
to join.
So as you walk up this
path, you are
guided into the Great Hall
by the guards of Lady Jamandi
Aldori.
And as you're walking up this path and being
guided into the hall,
the main
guard is sort of
sort of calling
you out, introducing you.
So let's go around the
table and have your character
introduced by name
and their physical description.
We have a volunteer.
Okay?
Probably right this way.
Good luck.
Hi.
I'm
M-Nom-Nom-Nom.
Sorry.
How do you spell that?
A-M-N-O-N
M-Nom.
Okay.
M-O-N
O-M-O
N-O-N
M-Nom-Nom.
What's your name?
Adam.
So
I'm a
white tiefling. I'm an albino.
And I'm a paladin
of the great
Lord and
apex predator, Dorn.
If you have
any questions, please, please
let me know. I would love to talk to all of you
about our
Lord and apex predator.
He's up and coming.
Pretty cool. Pretty cool.
My first time really out and about.
Pretty excited to
be out in the world and share
this message of
animal handling.
And
care treatment of animals.
Care treatment of animals.
Do I need to have a disclosure at the end of this adventure?
No animals were harmed in the making of this
DVD session?
If they are, there's going to be some big fucking trouble
for those assholes.
I can't forget myself. I'm sorry.
Depends on what the animal is.
On that point, this might
be one of the few campaigns where the animal
handling skill might actually be useful.
Oh, I'm a druid.
I check that a lot.
Yeah, just happy to be here.
Get to know you find
creatures like
really excited.
You hand me one pamphlet,
we're going to have a problem.
Anyone else like one? I have
a track actually
if you would, if you will.
Lots of cars stuck in here.
You look like you're
interested.
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.
I'm sorry.
Alright, who's next?
I'll go next.
Sure.
Green bumper.
I'm a canky ranger.
Black feathers.
Black feet.
Black clothes.
You specifically
are a little unnerving.
Yeah, well, I didn't know what's going on.
Yeah.
No.
No reasons.
Alright, Kenku.
Yeah, you ready to get some stuff done?
There are some Kenku
who can only speak and
mimic speech. Is your Kenku
able to speak Polly?
Yes.
Bank dorm.
I don't know.
That would have been
awesome.
You could only say things that other people
at the table have said.
It's like something that will literally keep a list of like
oh, I can use that for you.
That would be horrible.
I mean, it would be really hard, but
it would be funny as hell.
Oh yeah, see the legends of
so the Kenku shows up
and that's when he's like
can you imagine?
The paladin of Dorne is the only one
that is spoken so far.
He just says
all that
and we're like
are you a paladin?
And he's like, are you a paladin?
Wait twice if you're a paladin.
Yeah.
This is amazing.
Now we're home.
It's like I have a companion.
He's already seen the light.
I really hope I don't have that.
It is
not a requirement. It is one of those
suggestion films.
Alright, so Thumper, the Kenku
ranger.
Amnon, the alphino
chief of paladin.
Monomonon.
Monomonon.
No one at the table
is going to say your last name.
Every single time.
Okay, if that makes you uncomfortable you can call me brother Monomonon.
I am
Durgan Ironbeard.
A dwarf
cleric.
I am a
faithful
marshonary
of Thorn.
No.
A marshonary.
Jesus Christ.
I left my
clan to spread the word
of Thorn.
Did you leave or were you kicked out
for
refusing to not call yourself
a marshonary?
I happen to be a little overzealous for
that.
There is no overzealous
my friend.
How does one spell Durgan?
D-U-R-G-A-N.
Ironbeard.
I wrote Ironbear.
Either way.
I heard it both ways.
The book of Thorn with me and my
fossilized crocodile stone.
That's my seer stone.
What did we do?
We did some stripes.
I have to put it in my hat to read it
really well.
I'm glad to find another
fellow follower of Thorn.
Oh Lordy.
Oh boy.
Mistakes were made.
We should have voted for Clown.
I wanted to be found so bad.
I wanted to go out and be the
cat nerd.
I wanted to be the cloud one and
became the god.
I am Yannick Bushminder.
I'm a firgold druid.
I will be a circle of spores
once I get there.
So mushrooms and fungus.
Firgolds are
over 7 feet tall.
260 pounds.
They're big and they're blue.
Which I didn't realize it was another
blue character after I chose
Firgold.
I had this one spelling Yannick.
Y-A-N-N-I-C-K.
Originally I was going to be Yannick
Treetender.
There's too many trees.
There can't be too many trees.
When it comes to names there can't be.
I'm a farmer.
I wish I was a shrubber.
I specialize in shrubberies.
Yes.
Alright, anything else Yannick?
Nope.
Hi, I'm Treelon.
I am a barbarian.
I'm a lion.
I don't know if you can tell.
It's not a competition.
Pretty sure it is.
In this life I have to take what I can get.
I'm still trying to figure things out.
You like exactly 8 feet tall or 8 feet tall with boots on?
Yeah.
I disassociate a lot.
4% body fat.
He's totally 225.
Totally.
I met you actually.
He's probably 180.
My favorite part of that was he said he has
4% body fat.
The rest of it is what?
96% water.
Yeah.
Somebody said we're in danger of losing him to the draft.
I wonder what his 40 is.
The Hemsworth brothers.
This is what 6'3", 225 looks like.
Same thing with Alan Richardson.
That's the size and weight
that that is.
I'm like,
I told somebody at work
I can't believe it.
It doesn't matter.
Exactly.
Why is he lying about it?
Why is everybody so mad about it?
Because it's a stupid thing to lie about.
You'll lie about the little simple things
that are easy to verify.
It was a bright and sunny day
on my inauguration.
It was kind of rainy.
We have photographs of the sky.
That was the largest inauguration crowd ever.
In the history of inauguration crowds.
Yes.
Just the best inauguration crowd.
Does Treelon have a last name?
A surname? A family name?
Or is it just Treelon?
Just Treelon.
Sort of.
Way to go.
My turn?
I am
Nyxy Tinkerpeak.
I am a gnome
wizard.
Who comes from
a family of Tinkers that live on
a mountain.
She
thinks tinkering is boring.
So she's decided that she
wants to get into
magic instead.
Her hands
and her robes are
covered in
little bits of ink.
Because she loves
books.
Is them like cool tats?
Or ink stains?
Ink stains. Just ink stains.
Treelon thought she could eat them.
She was a really terrible scribe.
Her handwriting is really
awful.
So part of the reason that
no one else can read her spellbook
is that they just cannot read
her handwriting.
And she
wants to become a famous wizard.
Because that's what all wizards
want to be.
Totally altruistic.
Bring a bell.
When I think waffle good
I think wizard.
And honestly
they don't want to be famous.
They just want to be very powerful.
She wants to know all the
magic that she can.
She is descended
from
gnomes.
There is a small amount
of orbit.
Touched room.
She did descend from the mountain.
That's true.
There is a dwarf
from the Guloshkin mountain
range
that is far back in her family line.
Probably something like that.
Yes.
So her
family motto
is strong as the mountain.
She grew up
crafting.
So she's known to magic instead.
Why would you want to go to Japan?
I actually come from a family
of like eight kids.
Oh I know what that's like.
I want to.
I want to know what that's like.
How do you spell Nyxy?
NYXY.
She has red hair
and blue eyes and she wears really thick
glasses.
They make her eyeballs really big.
Yep. Nice.
Alright. Amnon
Manon Manon. Yes. The chief of paladin.
Thumper, Tinker Ranger.
Durgon Ironbeard, the dwarf
cleric and Martianary.
Yannick Bushminder,
the fear bowl druid.
Treewon, the Gawaii Barbarian.
And Nyxy Tinkerpeak,
the gnome wizard.
Gnome, dwarf,
she's got some actual balance
party.
Okay.
Too late to change my class.
What do you mean we're not a party of just
fighter, barbarian
That's all you need really.
Magic using
Martians.
What were you?
Fighter and rogue?
Fighter Ranger Rogue.
Those were his last two characters.
Yeah.
The first character was a fighter ranger
This last one was a rogue fighter.
Okay.
So, less on the ranger
side, more on the
everybody else side.
How do you get to be more smitey?
Yeah, I'm gonna smite this shit out of people.
Sounds good.
Because
as much as I love everyone, there's some people
that just need them. Smite.
Smited out of them. No.
Smited. The bad
smited out of them. That's it. Yes.
You are
the last
of the adventuring parties to be led
into the great hall.
And as the doors are being shut behind you
the first raindrops
are going to come.
Alright.
So.
Alright.
Alright, so this spacious hall has been prepared
for great feasts. Servants hustle and bustle
about while several armed soldiers
lady Jumanis house guards watch over the
hall from positions in the east
and west walls. To the north
the fire crackles in a large
fireplace. An iron oven secured
by a lock adorns the fireplace's eastern
base. Two massive
crystal chandeliers hang
from the ceiling 20 feet above. The walls are
decorated with painted murals of idyllic woodland
scenes. Nymphs
and waterfalls, satyrs dancing
with bongs and wooded glades, and various
winded fairy creatures flitting through the trees.
Nine long tables
arranged all around the central portion
of the room. Each holding plates, utensils,
mugs, droplets. Behold
ready to be poured pictures of air, wine,
meat, and water. The smell of roasted meat
and other delicious scents fill the room.
No food has yet
been served.
Alright, so you are all
escorted to the same table.
The six of you as well as
two other people.
You see also
among you is a
gnome gentleman
who seems to be very colorfully
dressed. And you also
see a human man
who seems to be
very attractive looking,
very noble looking,
very finely dressed.
So,
once you are directed to your seats
you see
a strikingly found woman enters
the hall followed by an aristocratic
middle-aged human man.
The man wears finely tailored clothing
fit for a noble while the woman appears dressed
for battle. She wears a fine leather coat
over a sparkling male shirt
and at her waist hangs an Aldori dueling
sword with a bright silver palm.
The two make their way to the head table
where they remain standing.
The man
speaks first. Greetings, heroes!
I am Ioseph Sellemius,
Lord Mayor of Rastov. And this,
you just pushed the woman beside him, is Lady
Jamani Aldori.
We both thank you for answering her call for heroes.
You may be few, but we need only the best
for this great task.
Lady Jamani offers the room a broad
smile before she speaks.
South of here, beyond Purvoi's border,
lies the Stolen Lands.
This disputed territory has been claimed time
and again by the would-be settlers, but
because the area has been a haven for bandits and
monsters, it has never been held for long.
Rastov intends for this to
change. If you have enough courage
to drive off the dangerous denizens of the
Stolen Lands, you can seize territory for yourselves
and name yourselves baronesses or
barons. Rastov intends
to recognize the legitimacy
of the new rulers of this land,
but none of the other neighboring realms care enough to
challenge you. We are prepared
to provide backing as a trade partner
and military ally. If you
claim the land, you will have my, indeed
all of Rastov's support.
She raises her gauntlet,
but the details of your individual missions
and charters into the Stolen Lands can wait.
I raise my glass to you,
as for now, let us eat
and enjoy the evening. Tomorrow promises to be
a very busy day.
And as she
finishes her speech, you see the
servants begin to serve food,
a very lavish feast
of very high quality food.
Is it like a buffet table?
Are they serving us?
Yeah, they're serving you. So they're serving multiple courses
that you're serving.
So the old gnome man at your table
sort of introduces himself.
I am Tartuccio.
And who might you be?
Are you part of the same
ragtag band of individuals?
Are you forming a group
together?
Yes.
Yeah, I'm
weird, but humble.
Excuse me, were you saying something?
Would you like to hear about our
latex predator,
Dorne? I would not.
Someone else. Another time then,
perhaps. Maybe you could set up an
appointment to come back later.
Have you been to the city of Patax
to the west? It's a great land.
I'm the king.
You're a vet.
Have you heard of that land at all?
I'll just pop some
buzzes at this point.
I'm not obsessed with you guys
leaving our town.
I'd like to talk some more, but
fuck him.
Have fun
dying out in the dirt. Good luck
on you.
Thanks for the fart.
The other
man sitting at the table
is now a villain.
The other man
sitting at the table with you, a human man,
he introduces himself as Maegar
Varn,
of the great noble house of Varn.
I assume you've heard of us.
Have we?
Would you like to hear about
our latex predator, Dorne?
I've been hearing more.
He's an upcoming
part of the Pantanon.
I think he's fantastic.
I've been hearing
this name more and more.
I have a track that you could
he started as a
mere crocodile,
this sweet
and angelic
reptile,
and then awakened
by great magics
to eventually become
a god.
So he was
as we are.
He is as we can become.
Amen.
He knows what I'm talking about.
I heard
that he was a crocodile
that was experimented on.
So
I'm sure all the gods have their own
creation of this. This one's awesome though, dude.
This just happened.
This is
Look into every religion there's
going to be.
There are many stories
and many myths.
No, but this happened.
I know this happened.
It's in a book.
I've got a book too.
It lays it out how
many of these stories are just allegorical in nature.
They tell these tales of things
that they did.
They tell us to teach us lessons.
Yes, yes.
Do we get the other guy back?
Because we are ragtag.
We definitely are ragtag.
I didn't actually go on a mission in real life.
This is your chance.
You're doing well.
You're doing well.
I remember having these
exact same conversations.
This is how I thought it would be.
I would not have made a good mission.
Is anybody proficient in history?
History?
Yes?
No.
Roll a history check.
Dice, we need dice.
Where are my dice?
Not the one that was rolling 2's and 3's.
Try this one.
Proficient in religion,
but might
need intelligence for that.
Alright, history.
24.
Yes!
First roll of the game.
Well, that was a good one.
Hopefully this is a sign of things to come.
Minus one.
So you know about
Maegar that he is the third son
of a Brevik baron and as such
he doesn't seem to inherit his father's title.
And so he kind of has to
make a name for himself.
Okay.
Suppose at that time he is here
even though he seems to be a double partner.
Having descended from
Nobles myself,
I can relate.
Is he looking to
join a team?
Or is he wanting to
sponsor a team?
I actually have my own
group. I apologize.
I already have my own.
I have retainers on hand
and I believe we're going to be heading
to the south and I think
some of you are going to be heading
more towards the west.
So I appreciate your
attempt to join that group.
I apologize.
I just want to know why you're at our table.
Oh.
You don't want to join.
Okay. I'll be going to the south.
You guys go to the west. It'll be great.
We'll have a great time.
I hear centaurs.
Centaurs.
Oh, I did hear that correctly.
Does anybody know
anything about warfare?
Does anybody have any sort of
ideas? Would you describe
your characters knowing about warfare?
No.
I'm a farmer.
I'm an acolyte.
So no?
A bunch of
scholars and
wood spoke.
I can't remember the details.
Well,
as a, you know,
make an
athletics check.
Nine. Nine.
No.
Eleven.
He starts going off on one of the stories
of some battle that he was involved in
and you have never heard of this
because you don't know the truth or anything.
He's just kind of nodding along
and it's kind of getting a little boring
after a little while.
Cool story, bro.
Does anybody
know anything about society
and sort of like the
dealings and such?
I want to know about
animals, crops,
mushrooms.
Really expensive stuff. I'm your guy.
I can make things.
Society?
Do you have
fever or what is it called?
Sleight of hand? Yes.
Make a sleight of hand.
Ten.
Ow.
What did you get?
Seven. Great.
One.
I mean with bonuses
like
plus six to sleight of hand.
Seven.
Okay.
You're kind of having discussions about stuff
and he's telling you about some of the noble houses
and you are just, none of you are sort of
picking up on his vibe.
Eventually you all sort of
get bored of each other and you go with him
going off to another table
to speak to some other people.
There are a couple other
people among the group
if you were so inclined to
visit them. Yes.
You see a
barbarian looking woman with a
sword that is
not as big as she is.
Think of like Cloud
when he was seven.
A gigantic sword.
You do see a dwarven
cleric. He seems to have a holy symbol
around his neck.
You see an elven woman who is
extremely pale.
And you
sort of see among her weapons
a massive scythe.
You see
a little
halfling.
She seems to have a lute with her.
And you see
an incredibly
attractive looking
human woman
raised in heavy armor.
If you so desire
you may go sort of speak with them
and learn
a little bit more about them or
if you don't care.
You're going to like to go talk to the
cleric.
Hey, can I come along with you?
Hello.
And lightning.
Alright, I'm just happy to be here.
Okay.
So far this is the best
ever.
People who
can hear him.
The fielders.
Green?
Harvesting, I think.
Right.
That was
a little tartutio
there now.
Oh, yeah.
Well, this is the guy
that was super rude to us
at the beginning.
He's got some thick pockets.
Does it hit those
gnomes?
Alright, do you want to talk to
the bug bearer's program?
Do you not see
him?
Alright.
Alright,
this is the work of the cleric.
Looks like a lot
of fun.
Soon this dinner will be
over.
Where does it even clear up?
I was going to say, I want to see what this
holy sample is.
Make a religion check.
Doctor.
And
cleric of entropy.
23.
23.
You notice that he is wearing the holy
symbol of the god Groetus.
Which you know
to be
a god of the end times.
Sort of
saying that like all
these things come to an end. Eventually we will
reach the end times of the universe.
But no matter how great or terrible
things might be,
they will be.
He's right and they're coming to people.
You also
with your very high score know that
that
Oh, Groetus
and his clerics usually try to
accelerate the end times.
Just you know, try to
bring them out just a little bit faster.
You know, we all need an apocalypse
every once in a while.
Picking up and putting down.
It's not a bad thing.
Some people aren't
ready to be going.
You know, every
winter comes.
We're doing pretty good so far.
For every spring, there is a winter.
And
it's just the normal cycle.
Yeah, for every winter
there's a spring.
Not so much
for Grimace.
They want winter to come
and winter to never happen.
How do you
how does the work go?
It's continuous.
It's not limited.
But it will be.
We have
specific plans for the
new Lost Lands adventure.
Well, I've heard that there are some
ruins there. I've heard perhaps
that there are some
ruins of some dwarven civilization.
You know, as all civilizations
come to an end.
I thought perhaps we could learn
what caused their civilization to end.
And maybe use that
on this one.
We haven't even started it yet.
Excuse me, do you mind
if I smoke?
Why would Zoe rather you didn't?
But
I mean, the mic's a cigarette.
Not in any way.
I will pray for you, brother.
He's drinking heavy.
He's hitting the wine bottles quite heavily.
Look, chain's smoking.
All good ones come out.
Yeah, okay.
God will be with you, brother.
Yeah, so I hear you have a new
god.
Do we really need new ones?
Well, um,
I think this one's different. I actually didn't like him.
He's my own personal
Lord Apex Predator.
Dorn.
The Bloodborne.
If needed.
I'm picking up what you're putting down.
Do you care for a cigarette?
No, no, thank you.
Have you heard of Dorn
in your travels? Have you encountered any
marginaries?
I think you might be the first.
No, that's...
Not to poke too many holes in it, but
Apex Predators don't just kill them.
There's some thought
to both of you. There's a purpose.
I just
have a purpose
under
the blood of Dorn.
I'd like to suggest one more family by name
Andrew.
You've already met a religion. I want you to make a
religion check for me as you're sort of teaching
him about the teachings of Dorn.
I'm so good at this too.
A nine.
I feel like I should have picked something other than
religion to be sufficient in.
We can all help each other
out.
We'll have a little
scripture study before we go to bed
tonight and wake up and have another one.
Well, I worship a different
god than you guys do.
As you're telling him about Dorn, he
kind of starts
speaking over you. Let me tell you about
the deepening of your emotions.
He sounds like a great...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
This is a different sheet. I don't know where I'm going to put it.
Right here.
But not in your hand.
So,
that's the total number there.
I think you added
a proficiency bonus to it as well.
So you add 9 to it, so you get 14.
It's also a new sheet.
So he sort of starts talking about Dwarven culture
and stuff like that.
You as a fellow Dwarven person.
I'm wondering around if there are any plants or trees or anything I can go hang out with.
I would like to glean whatever I can remember about that.
This is amazing.
What some people believe is just fascinating.
Yeah, so you guys are kind of off in that discussion.
Trelon,
you see that woman with the gigantic sword
sits down in front of you.
What do you want to do first?
Arm wrestling?
Oh, you're up in the stakes.
Anybody want to put some money on this one?
I think I can take it.
Oh, shit.
I think I just heard an audible plant.
Make an athletic check for me.
I don't have any yet.
15.
I have to save up because spells are expensive.
Best two out of three.
Best five out of eight.
I'll let you touch me as much as you want.
Hey, kids.
I let you win that time.
I'm trying to make you feel good.
I got a one.
I think she just pulled my groin.
She got a 16.
Two out of three.
One more time.
What do I get if I win?
I got a magical deck.
I'm in.
What'd you get?
12.
Let's see what Russell's doing.
In the process, my fear spills.
Disturbance.
Bring talus.
I guess I get to keep this dagger, then.
What do you got?
I'll let you look at my sword.
You just want to look at my sword.
Do you have a sword?
Make an intimidation check.
There we go.
I'm intimidating myself right now.
22.
As you're comparing weapons, hers is very massive and stuff.
Yours just looks so heavy.
You carry this around all the time, and she hands you her sword, and you immediately drop to the ground.
I'm like, how do I hold this thing?
I like the weight of that one.
That's a very fine looking dagger.
Make an intelligence check.
6 minus 3.
This could have been made from the tooth of a dragon.
This is clearly some sort of metallic dragon.
Tell me about this.
What is it?
Teemu.
We've got magic daggers at home.
This was given to me by my tribe.
This is my award for committing the great task of reaching the age of 19.
How old are you now?
19.
She produces an ID that proves she is an adult.
It's just a piece of paper that says, I am 19.
How about we do one more contest and we'll wager your dagger?
I already won the last one.
Let's add some apple.
Who wants to do drinks? Shots!
I'm in.
Sit over here.
Some guy turned water into wine.
That could be our contest.
Are you willing to wager your dagger on it again?
I'm in.
She's human.
Make a constitution saving throw.
13.
She won that round.
How many rounds are we doing?
No shot.
25.
She's getting super tipsy.
Final one.
8.
She's sweating.
You're about ready to fall on the floor.
I got you in the legs.
What else can I get you?
Riddles.
What have I got in my scabbard?
That was the riddle.
What do I have in my scabbard?
I don't know what you have in your scabbard.
What's in my scabbard?
The air.
Anybody else joining the drinking contest?
No thank you.
Yannick.
Let's do this.
What's up?
You guys want to party?
You walk like a guy who likes to party.
I was going to try and spike people's drinks, but I was going to see where this was going.
Megan, nature check.
23.
He already had spiked people's drinks.
That's what's happening right now.
She looks in her scabbard and she goes,
it's full of stars.
Your button.
I don't already have a clue.
It really pains me to say that.
You seem like such a person.
Perhaps we can offer you a better way.
When it's not full of betrayal
and heartache.
Or you can just hang out with me and do shrooms on the weekends.
You guys are going west, right?
No.
One guy said that he thought we were going west.
We actually haven't gotten our assignment yet.
I thought he said we.
Where's that?
How far?
Perfect.
Just so you know, in game,
every time that is said, my character rolls his eyes.
With an audible sigh.
I have a feeling that phrase is going to be uttered
a lot.
You know what's better?
Because if there was just one dormant,
they'd end up drinking all your beer.
So, Donnie,
the character comes over to Thumber.
Pale looking elf woman.
She sees your outfit, your garb.
With that sigh, you could say that she's a sight.
I don't think she's a couple.
Thumber.
What do you know about Kobolds?
What do you know about Kobolds?
I'm going to go this way.
Why do you want to know about Kobolds?
Why do you want to know about Kobolds?
Also with the caves.
I mean, personal information.
You have to be discerning about those we entertain
with our presence.
Not discriminatory.
It's not like the other guy that we should know.
It raises them with extra steps.
No.
This little known woman.
Is she in a band?
Lindsey and the Banshees?
I know you're the only older known here,
so maybe this is weird that I came down to sit with you,
but I didn't come over here to talk to you because you're known.
Where'd you get those frames?
I made them.
What's all this?
My inkstone.
I use a lot of ink.
Have you written any books?
I don't do that kind of writing.
I totally agree with you.
Spells. I do a lot of transcribing of spells.
Tell me about that.
Making Arcana.
Arcana.
23.
I'm kind of doing some press digitation stuff.
She's enthralled by this.
I don't know.
Or is it all just like references?
I read everything.
Books about magic and adventure.
I definitely love books about adventure.
All the things that monsters can do.
All the things that might do to you.
She starts with telling this tale of a book she's been reading.
Just totally make sure your cheeks blush and all that.
Is there anything else anybody would like to do among this feast?
The people are charged.
Are they sitting at the table?
As I'm talking to this
or I'm listening to her tell me about her story.
Doing some little bits of magic.
After 10 minutes I hand her this little box
and say, I made you a music box.
It has a monster inside of it
that jumps up and plays music.
I hate tinkering.
Magic!
Is it real? Is it an illusion? Is it going to last?
It's real. It will last for the day.
What's the ability called?
Magic ticker box.
Prestidigitation.
I can use prestidigitation to create a tiny clockwork device.
Prestidigitation. Magic. Magic.
It is magic.
Make a check for me.
Make a check for me.
Yeah, because it's magic.
It's magic.
She really loves it. She's like, this is really cool.
It's still really cool.
Thank you.
Thank you for sharing your story.
The feast begins to draw to a close.
Anybody who...
Lady Jomandi, Altori, and the North Mayor
and anybody who approaches them and says,
tonight is just for celebration.
Throughout this feast, you can hear thunder
outside from the storm.
It's raining quite hard.
Lady Jomandi steps up
and says, my friends, I hope you have enjoyed the food and drink this evening.
Her words are quickly met with a round of cheers.
Smiling brightly, she continues, you honor me truly,
but this night is for you. As heroes, you have responded to my call.
Tomorrow, I shall speak with you all about your individual charges.
I suspect people will be at this day.
She kind of looks over at some of the people who are a little bit more drunk and high than others.
It would be well of you to get some rest tonight.
After all, you have kingdoms to plan.
She gestures to the large double doors of east and west.
Of course, I have arranged bedchimps for all of you. My guards will escort you to them now.
I hope you find them quite restful. Again, we have much work to do tomorrow.
We shall speak then, and we hope to meet you back at sunrise.
Good night.
The guards escort you off to the guest wing.
Among other groups you see, some of the other adventures that you saw
were some well-armored gentlemen who basically kept their helmets on
the entire night. They would essentially just lift their visor in order to put their food in,
but then put their visors back on, keeping to themselves. Anybody who tried to approach them,
they did not speak with at all.
The guards are escorting people to their guest rooms
and stuff.
It's not so much like you're coupled with the guards.
It's just kind of like, you're going off this thing here.
Oh, well, we can escort you to your room.
So they actually lead the men.
Meghar Var, the gentleman, the woman who we spoke to before,
he says, I do have some other matters to attend to tonight.
I will be back in the morning, probably not for the first day, but I will be back.
I will see you all tomorrow.
Alright.
Alright, so you want to escort him to your room.
Oh, one other thing I'll point out. I'm going to use the
Pathfinder method of experience, where in order to level up you have to get a thousand experience points,
like the DMV line, which is like thresholds.
And 44,000 is the level of whatever it is.
Things that you fight that are lower level than you,
you'll get less experience points.
And it's not just fighting monsters, it's accomplishing things,
completing quests, perhaps rallying people to your cause,
whether that be the cause of your kingdom or your god, that's up to you.
Did anybody else partake in the mushrooms?
Are you feeling okay?
I can help you get that feeling to pass,
so you can get back the feeling of your regular self.
It's merely a blessing from my god.
You may have me confused with someone else.
You may have me confused with someone else.
I just offered, it's no...
We'll see it tomorrow. Sleep good.
We can talk, but I...
When you partake, I'll partake.
So you get into your bunk beds.
These are so cool.
There's a total of eight beds.
The power of imagination.
Anybody else need to do anything tonight?
Anything that follows a door and I have to do before they set down?
A mud mask?
Book of Gorman's Day.
Which they do in the hallway.
You don't want to get slapped.
What's people's armor?
What equipment do you have?
Leather.
Roads.
Barbarians tend to go unarmored.
One cloth.
Stead of leather.
Go to bed.
Go to bed.
Go to sleep.
I'm out in the...
Tree lawn.
I can smell colors.
I don't...
Being a farmer and a druid, I don't like sleeping indoors.
Right in front of the door.
I need to get me some of those cards.
Yes.
So it's...
I make a five-foot radius on the floor with rope.
And when I finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.
And the trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful intelligence check against my spell save to be discerned.
It triggers when a small, medium, or large creature moves onto the ground or floor in the spell radius.
And the creature must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air,
leaving it hanging upside down three feet above the ground.
And the creature is restrained until the spell ends.
So it'll last for eight hours.
I'll pull over.
Yeah, you know it's there.
Chamber pot.
You're not getting up for eight hours.
You're out.
Okay.
In the middle of the night, around 3 a.m.,
you are suddenly awoken.
I trust the snare.
You hear that wakes you from sleep.
They cry, No! No!
He's gargling at three in the morning.
What do you do?
It all sort of startled you awake.
Remember that you cannot sleep in armor.
Make a constitution save.
12 or 14.
I'm going to give you like a minus one perception check.
I'm going to sign up the crocodile.
Remember to get dressed in my armor.
Is that the sure sign of the crocodile?
Here we go later.
Was the noise right outside our door?
I won't put my armor on, but I'm going to go stand out in the hallway.
Yeah, I'm going to look out the hallway.
I did pick up my shield, but I'm just looking.
I am prepared to cast fireballs if anything
comes through the door or looks scary.
I think someone might need help because there's no reason to gargle at three in the morning.
You're exiting the room?
People can leave if they want.
I'm going to jump over my snare.
It's still there.
I'm staying on my bed.
Once one person triggers it, it's gone.
Make a perception check.
11.
As you sort of glance outside of the door,
you see several men dressed in
dark armor bound in dark clothes.
You see one of them dragging the body off.
You see a couple others approaching towards your door.
I yell, roll a stuff check for me.
You're like, hey!
I trip and drop my weapon.
I farted.
I got a four on my stuff check.
Unable to control it, as you see these guys,
they suddenly turn towards you.
I duck back and tell everybody to back away from the door.
I whisper to everyone in our room to back away from the door.
Hopefully the first guy will hit the trap.
How do I play D&D?
Exactly.
Roll a twin and add deaths.
Actually, you get to add some.
I have a bonus modifier.
Is it already in there?
Yeah, so I think it's already calculated into the six.
Because usually it's very high.
Because usually that's just your dexterity modifier as your initiative score.
So if your dexterity modifier is four, your initiative modifier is six.
This is skill checks.
So this will change as you level up.
Yeah, so that is already populated
with that plus two ability.
That is 17.
14.
21.
One of them does stuff.
And I got 14 also.
He will do what he's done.
A lot of dice getting thrown across there.
There's a lot of people in the building.
All the bad guys could be regular people too.
Pete, where'd you go?
Pete, where'd you go?
10.
They're all zombie creatures now.
Maybe I'll harvest them.
17.
18.
14.
All right.
Well, when we were all choosing minis,
why didn't you speak up?
I found one for him.
I found one for you.
I had the whole bag here.
Who needs help finding a mini?
Do you want to be a cat face dwarf?
You didn't say no.
There's no better option.
Huh?
Where I was before, I think.
It's bright.
One of these guys is red.
I was here and I poked out.
These two guys.
Over here.
So there's two guys on that side.
If I could put them one more square that way.
I saw them and they were kind of dragging along.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, I shouldn't have put your character's tree lawn.
You were up first.
The snare is still active.
So are you standing on the snare?
No, it's right in front of the door.
So I just positioned myself to the side of the snare and I ready my avalanche.
Okay.
Okay.
Tiny compared to a lot of everybody else.
As soon as someone pops their head in.
I am not.
I'm going to ready my attack.
Can we do that?
Until someone pokes their head in.
I'm wearing my white garments, if you will.
I believe they have significant protection.
They're woven from flax.
Thumper.
I just grab my bow and my quiver and clip those.
Ready? Pointing at the door.
So pulling those out would just be like a move action.
Okay.
I forgot to run off the spell sheets.
How many spells does it do?
I've got like four cantors.
Your spell safety is ten plus your ability modifier.
That's what I thought it was.
This guy.
Just right in front of the door.
Let's see.
I am not.
So you can make your ready attack.
And then the snare is just one more hand.
It's actually inside of the room.
I didn't want someone walking behind the hallway to get clipped by it.
Eleven?
Longsword.
Swipes across.
Thumper.
That was his movement.
He has an attack.
Seeing you all.
He shouts to his buddy, there's six of them.
And he fires his hand crossbow.
He's just going to fire the person who clipped straight into the room.
I'm nervous.
I'm like.
Nobody is directly as drunk.
That's a 23.
It scratches me.
It's over three points of piercing.
I forget how wimpy the hits are at this level.
Three.
Nathaniel's character's name that I totally remember.
Durgon.
Durgon.
Durgon the doorman.
My turn?
He's outside of the room, but he has a clear view of the inside.
Spirit of Dorn like a fire is burning.
And then I cast sacred flame.
Is that an attack roll or a reflex save?
It's a dexterity.
I'm pretty sure they're flat footed too out there.
If I say weird things.
Does a ten beat your spell save, DC?
All right, do your damage.
I've tried this sooner, he's just happy for it.
One damage.
Radiant damage, yeah.
Radiance.
I'm going to attempt using the VTT.
I'll see how it goes.
You still have movement.
Where's the iron?
Nyxy.
I cast mage armor.
You have movement?
I think that's my turn.
All right.
He drops the body and he pulls out his weapon.
We'll move him right next to the other guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
I could have made it so they wouldn't have seen me when I pulled my head out.
I have hidden step so I can turn invisible with bonus action.
Yeah, there was something.
I don't know what his was, but there was the project for getting it.
Are there clairs for getting a double?
Yeah.
That was groggy, I just woke up.
Make a ranged attack.
You're going to add your dexterity and your proficiency.
13.
That's cool.
What button is it?
9?
Yep.
Nine?
Nine.
As he comes around the corner, you get him right in the truck.
Nice.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
He is going to fire his crossbow at M9.
Not cool, man.
That should work.
I'm not sure how we got past these garments though.
Oh, I know, right in the arm.
You suffered five points of piercing damage.
That's going to leave a mark.
That was five?
That should have gone way less.
There's already a schism in the ranks of the religion.
Can we please use the term secret?
Well, these are more secret actually.
Very secret.
Secret.
All right.
I'm going to do a guy that's standing right in the doorway.
I'm going to hit him with a poison spurt.
I'm going to hit him with a poison spurt.
Three, two, one.
Three, two, one.
I'm going to hit him with a poison spurt.
There's the creature must succeed on a constitution saving throw.
So, I rolled an 8, it's 1d12, it's 1d12, yeah.
11!
He collapses to the ground, screaming in pain,
I know this, cries, suddenly, it's stocked.
A square is spiking.
Yes.
I was like, in my head, I was like,
they don't have a lot of hit points, and this,
poison, I just killed this dude, like,
that was brutal.
What?
I'm a mushroom farmer.
Nice.
Don't fuck with me.
Big squares are little squares.
I just imagine you're like, macing the guy,
spraying his drugs, yeah, and you can see him.
Well, there's little squares on the big squares, yeah.
Use the big squares.
Thank you.
The size of the people.
Well, actually, that's the size,
I mean, that's the size of her.
Is our room drawn to scale?
No.
I believe they should be one inch.
She can sleep.
If this was your first campaign,
I would let you slide on that,
but we've played with these guys so many times,
and each one is five by five.
The whole time, it's been like that.
So you're gonna publicly shame me.
Yes.
So don't ask any more questions.
Yeah.
Yeah, give me anything else.
No.
Are you sure you don't wanna do
a loose action to shame me again?
I'll save it for next time.
I might use my reaction.
Let's do this, guys.
I gotta do something out in the hallway.
That guy, the far guy, moves in front of the door.
What's he doing?
Two quirks.
Stepping over them.
Well, one's dissolved.
One's a crossbow.
Oh, shit.
One's kind of squishy.
Yeah.
Let's see.
I'm gonna roll one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Who is he?
Four players at Trelawn.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know very well.
Yeah, boy.
Towards you, you're going down every time.
You're like, silence.
That's not you.
Trelawn, it's your turn.
Okay, well, I'm gonna do a bonus action.
I'm gonna do my little clouds jaunt.
And come right there.
Are you that character or are you the other one?
I'm this character.
You are that one.
Have you been firing at the wrong character?
I was thinking that was him
because he would yell by no one.
Is that not true?
No.
No, he has the horn.
Yes.
That's why I didn't understand why you were shooting at me.
Okay.
Because that's what it says in the workplace.
I didn't want to question anybody.
I should have asked.
I didn't.
I'm like, he's a little by no.
There you go.
I want to see.
It's the white guy.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry to misuse your minute color.
That's racist.
Obviously, I'm the one with horns.
Does it make you horny, baby?
Yes, actually.
They're right there all the time.
I can't get away from them.
They're a lot of fun stuff.
Tell me about clouds jaunt.
I can go 30 feet.
I can teleport and click space that I can see.
Bonus action.
And now I want to swing.
Okay.
May I swing?
Your wife is in the back.
Yep.
This is a no judgment zone.
There are pineapples in the hallway.
Upside down.
The weapon hadn't quite manifested back from a cloud.
Oh, there's nothing there.
You did it with a pair.
I fought to do it.
I jaunted, you attacked.
I have jaundice.
So your jaunt is a bonus action?
Yes.
Is that correct?
So you still have movement if you still have jaunt.
Yes.
I will pull down across the room.
Okay.
All right.
M9.
Yes.
Firebolt.
Okay.
Yeah, whoever's right now.
Attack roll?
Yeah, I don't remember where you slept.
Is it Firebolt?
Firebolt.
It does one-detent fire damage.
Where do you get this Firebolt?
Is it from being a paladin?
Is it from the magic industry?
It is from
being a
internal
Is it a ranged attack?
Yes.
Yeah, it is.
Do you,
Up to 120 feet.
Yes.
Okay.
So Prisma-based.
Play it at plus two.
So Prisma plus two, plus your proficiency.
So plus four hours.
Oh, that was a total of 14.
14.
It's exact.
Take
nine points of
Phyra.
No, six.
Six points.
Yeah.
Let me see if this is for your July.
Yes.
It's actually in July.
That's what I wanted it to be.
You Dorn folks aren't very good at numbers, are you?
Tell me those are the number of balls that are going.
Oh.
Super high.
Yes.
You know, Kate, you don't need a brain.
You need.
You walk around.
Amped on it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna lay on hands myself
and replace those five hit points I lost
as a bonus action.
Bonus action.
Okay.
So, yeah.
That's it.
You're going to point.
Yep.
It's the first turn.
I'm gonna move.
And I'm gonna do a bonus action.
Hunter's Mark on this.
Five versus five.
Fireball.
And then I'm going to shoot him.
Okay.
Warrior Reign's attack.
14.
14 hits.
Cool.
I got a six for damage.
And then.
Hunter's Mark is in there.
14, six for damage.
11.
11 total.
You get him right in the brain pan.
Nice.
You've moved.
You've acted.
All right.
Seeing his combat's falling.
Fuckers.
He's going to drop the crossbow
and he's going to rush into the room.
Good, good.
He's rushing.
Yeah, he's going to stop right there.
It's the Willem.
All right, what is he gonna do?
Dexterity saving through.
Nine.
Nine.
Yes.
Failed.
So now he's magically hoisted into the air.
Pinata.
He is hanging upside down,
three feet above the ground.
And he is restrained.
You fuckers.
I'll kill every one of you.
I'll kill every one of you.
You're gonna fucking die.
We would be brothers.
You want me to do a non-lethal attack?
Like knock him out of question?
Juergen.
So there's nobody.
That guy's hanging upside down.
What was he like?
There's nobody else in the room.
Correct.
I actually want to move past him.
He's in the hallway.
He is just kind of hanging there upside down.
He's hanging out.
So we're going to see the one guy in the hallway.
And step out.
Does he get an opportunity to attack if you push by him?
I know he's restrained.
Oh, he's restrained, yeah.
I love this.
All right, what are you doing?
I stepped in the hallway.
Did you see the one guy?
Yeah.
Okay.
So I'm gonna cast guiding bolts.
I'm gonna bolt right in the brain.
Spell check.
So eight to hit.
Eight.
Guess that's all I'm doing.
Nyxy's turn.
All right, she is going to cast firebolt
and that's the guy that is hanging upside down.
Okay, if you have attack, he's restrained,
so you can get an advantage.
Oh.
Oh.
24.
Nine.
What's that talking about?
Not anymore.
Woo.
Should try and take somebody alive.
Yeah, well, sorry.
I didn't want to keep them alive, Spell.
He's just punching him.
No, I can't.
He's restrained.
Hey, he's upside down.
He's restrained.
He doesn't go anywhere.
Just walk over and smack him.
I'm like three feet tall, you guys.
So you can walk underneath him.
He's three feet off the ground.
He's three feet off the ground.
Oh.
Just walk underneath him.
Instead, she firebolted him right in the face.
Yeah.
His face is just nothing but.
She's like, oh, you guys, oh.
His face looks like the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Did you see that?
Wow.
Okay.
Damn it.
You fucking murder robos.
We don't know what's going on here.
He's trying to put a soft firebolt on his face.
Yannick.
He's trying to put some English on it.
Instead, she put some Scots on it
and just killed the fucker right after.
Oh.
I guess, all right, let's.
I kind of wanted to find out what's going on,
so I'm gonna step out in the hallway.
Okay.
You can clearly see over here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I'm gonna cast Entangle.
Okay.
And unfortunately, it's probably gonna hit
my, both of them as well.
Perfect.
Me too.
Here's one.
These guys.
Oh, these guys are.
Oh.
Actually, I could just do it.
These two.
Because it's,
20 foot square starting from a point within range
and it's up to 90 feet away.
So, for the duration, the plants are gonna turn the area
into difficult terrain.
It's like weeds and vines and sprouts
that grab everybody.
And creatures in the area when I cast a spell
must succeed on a strength saving throw
or be restrained by the entangling plants
until the spell ends.
And then, on their turn, they can use an action
to make a strength check against my DC to agree.
Is your DC 12?
It is higher than mine.
He is entangled plant.
All right.
Trelawn, let's make a strength saving throw.
Do, do, do, do, do.
19.
He's good.
Okay, so, but it's still 20.
So it's difficult terrain and he's restrained.
So I'm gonna be like,
let's not kill him.
Let's figure out what the hell's going on.
Keep Christie's character away from him.
Yeah.
Keep the murder gnome away from.
I didn't mean to hit him so hard, you guys.
Executing harmless prisoners.
This is like some, come on.
How many have you killed?
I killed one that was free moving around
and he was literally coming in to attack us.
Then I restrained one.
You murdered him, helpless.
He was a helpless guy, murdered.
So now I have this one.
This is right.
He was more of help.
He was more help to become unalive.
But I will say this.
We still need to beat him in this initiative.
So, he can still punch him and beat him.
We just don't non-lethal damage.
Don't non-lethal, gotcha.
Anything else?
No.
I want to walk into the hallway and shoot him.
It's his turn.
So.
You can make a strength check against it.
Yeah, I was gonna say he is,
let's have this guy just roll around.
He is going to drop his crossbow
and pull out a dagger.
So it takes an action to try to break free?
Yeah.
You use its action to make a strength check
against my spell saves.
Strength.
I want you to have your strength condition.
Your speed is zero.
Attack is up against you
other than your natural attack is very much.
He's going for it.
He is going to attack Trelawn.
Great.
On the blue one.
Of course, he attacked.
No.
I can't tell.
Is it the war adjacent to him?
Yeah.
Okay.
He's right in front of him.
He's in the sector.
Natural one.
I think it's Trelawn's turn.
So he's loose?
No.
No?
He's still restrained.
Oh, we don't want to kill him.
We can do whatever we want.
I would rather we question him
to figure out what's going on, but same.
You decide to murder him.
I can't stop you.
That seems to be the theme.
Well, I'm just going to prepare him a question.
I reach around, grab his left ear.
And I rip it off.
It's like, you reach around, you grab his, what?
How was that?
Who's feeling what now?
I grab his left ear.
Oh, you have no idea.
And I rip it off.
Oh, would you look at the time?
Just punch him.
No, I knew what I wanted to do.
You have a club.
Just beat him with it.
I don't want to kill him.
Yeah, you could do non-legal, right?
Yeah.
I'm not smart enough.
I don't know the difference.
I want his left ear.
His left is scarred in color.
Didn't you do that before?
Yeah.
No, not an ear.
It's a knife.
Oh, yeah.
Definitely, yeah.
He's going to abandon him.
It was with our fork, our little purple fork.
Yeah, what was the name?
Hot bubbling.
Hot bubbling.
Fury.
Fury.
Furry.
Obok.
Obok.
Not to be confused with Bob Doerr the Bildor.
Of the Bildor trial.
Ripping off an ear is hard.
I'm going to bite it off.
I'm not going to be proficient in blind attacks.
He might bite the attacks.
No, I'm just going to rip it off.
Okay.
Make an attack roll against restraints.
You get advantage.
This would just be like your striking.
Like I went on the attack.
Um, strength?
Heart?
Yeah.
21?
21 hits.
What about a D4 pusher strength?
Huh?
D4?
No, I think this would just be one pusher strength.
You don't have to attack the roll.
You don't have to attack the sword.
So you do butcher strength bonus.
Four.
So you deal five points of damage to them.
They get the ear?
Make a roll.
Roll a D20.
Equally likely.
Not equally unlikely.
Equally likely.
Want to roll a D20?
Yes.
Do I add anything to it?
Nope.
12.
Or 21 if we do this one.
I rolled from my, I rolled from my way.
And I deal five points of damage.
And I get his ear.
You're too cocky to have it.
Just you wait.
Oh.
Yeah.
There it is.
Anything else?
21.
I'm just gonna smile.
And then put the ear in the pouch.
Okay.
Slap him on the ass.
And I'm done.
Reach around and then I slap him on the ass.
What more could I do?
You need to add that to my,
I need to add that to my treasures.
Go for it.
One ear left is important.
Left ear.
Not one ear left.
One left ear.
That guy does have one ear left though.
But it's not the left ear.
You're right.
Who's on first?
Oh my God.
It is Ambon's turn.
Okay so we got a little guy restrained here.
Ask him to restrain.
See if he wants to hear.
I'm missing an ear.
If your Ambon's in, chop off an arm like this.
Take his tongue out.
Yes, yes.
He should probably cut off an arm.
Okay.
Go out in the hallway and look for other.
My eyes peeled.
Make a perception check for me.
Well this will be good.
Okay.
Oh jeez.
Perception.
Perception.
18.
You see the dead body of a guard.
And you also see that there are a number of court vessels
that are fully closed.
To the north, and to the south.
Court call us.
It's like a gate that the gated pathway goes down.
Calling some casters.
They are closed and they won't see them.
That's what you mean.
It's not there any that look woven.
Okay.
Just the otter one.
Okay.
I'm gonna kill myself.
I know.
My actual self, not my character.
Like my actual self.
It is the thumb first turn.
I'm gonna walk over to here and start running pockets.
All right.
Start searching the dead ones.
There's one that's making a face.
There's one that melted.
There's one that's broke.
One missing in here.
He's still alive.
Then there's these dead ones.
Five?
One, two, three, four, five, yep.
And one of them's still alive.
Okay.
They look like they have in a quick search
you can do in a single round.
You see the right step of leather,
that hand crossbows and has a dagger.
That's what you can see in a single round.
You know how to just take all their shit.
Yeah, you can pick up one thing at the moment.
Just pissing me off, first of all, how about this?
Eyes that hold all the people that once held everyone else.
Oh, you do?
Well, you kind of use your action at a certain moment.
You can still have a little bit of movement,
so desired or a bonus action,
but that would be all the care you can do.
Okay.
Yeah, so you see the remaining one.
More than three, five.
You see the remaining cut throat, restrained by bottomless.
It's gonna get over to where you did that.
Yeah.
There's doors with seals on them.
Seals.
But no, no walrus, no sea lion with seals.
Even a baby seal?
Is mimicry a action?
I don't.
No.
Features, what do you say?
I think that's the thing that was you talking about.
So this one must be imitate sounds
or voices that I've heard.
So you'd like to see people.
Probably be an action.
What was that?
I don't think you can have that.
Maybe it was push-up, push-up,
something like that, push-up, push-up,
or something like that.
Um, generally speaking,
like saying stuff on your turn is a free action,
but you have to keep in mind that it's six seconds.
So anything you can say within a six-second period.
Four score.
Yep.
It is Durgin's turn.
Okay, I'm gonna cast a,
Bama Durgin.
Okay.
To create a booming voice.
And I'm going to say that in six seconds
is all I can write.
So who are you in a booming voice?
Who are you and why are you here?
All right.
So I need to advantage on it.
Yeah, make an intelligent choice.
And I feel like you should be at this advantage
just because you can speak.
That's your question.
You are saying it in a booming voice.
It's a booming voice.
You can hear it just fine.
What do you know?
What do you say?
It's a regular voice.
Nine.
That's another advantage.
Oh, sorry.
Nine.
20.
Oh, 20.
Okay.
There you go.
I'm just gonna chill.
And you can tell, you know, he's kind of freaked out.
Sees that he's surrounded.
Somebody ripped off his ear.
He's got, you know, clearly a magic user of great renown.
And he looks ready to give up the fight.
That is the end of
Dirk?
Dirk.
Dirk.
Dirk.
Durgin.
Durgin.
Durgins.
Kristy, it is Nyxy's turn.
Sage of Bloodlust.
Jumps down.
If you kill this one,
I'm gonna think you're in league with them
and afraid of what they're gonna say.
Because this is two that you have murdered.
She cast.
Pressed a digitation on the guy that went home
and cleans all the blood and stuff off of him.
As much as she can.
She's gonna just clean him up a little bit.
Offer him a cigarette.
See, I can help.
My turn.
Yannick.
Bad cop and bad cop.
The same role.
The bold strategy.
The bold move, Cotton.
So Yannick, do you think between all of these things,
you might have defeated this guy?
What would you like to do?
We'll say that we're out of combat at this point.
I mean, at this time, has anybody else,
like we've been fighting for,
I mean, only for, I mean, a few seconds or so.
You can hear sounds of more, like clatter,
fighting and stuff, probably to the west.
This way.
Yeah, ain't nothing there.
You can hear more sounds going that way.
I mean, the side of the area that you're on.
Oh my God, I'm deaf.
Oh no.
I mean, so this, you said over here,
these are like gates that are like shut.
Yes.
Over here.
Okay.
It's impossible to unlock this.
And they're sealed too, so don't even think about it.
I mean, I would kind of figure we post it up somewhere
with our guy, like actually tie him up
because the vines and stuff are fine,
but they'll go away in the last minute.
I do have rope for out of combat when you tie him up.
I don't have anything that can help with that.
Let's take some of these vines on the ground.
Let's drop some of those around them.
They disappear.
The plants.
Over here has some ropes.
Yeah, so we're going to tie up the guy.
Okay.
So before the vines actually like disappear.
No, you would all the time.
I'm a farmer.
So, yep.
So what's this?
You're gonna let me live.
You give us some answers.
That one.
And then we'll sit in the green.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Green in the raw material plane.
I'm looking at it and you see that he has a tattoo
underneath his left eye that has like three black teardrops.
Well, he just said it hadn't.
The port of it.
Quick, somebody get some ice.
All right.
Three teardrops.
Tattoo.
Now, since we're out of combat and we do a little more
like a thorough searching into that.
Yep.
Who is the person that they killed?
That's what I wanted to know.
He was a guard.
He was one of the guards.
Yeah, so as you're searching them,
oh yeah, you see on all of the cutthroats,
hand crossbow, daggers, double of the armor, bolts.
Tattoos.
Look at that personal stuff,
like can bring black women and families with.
They specifically did not bring this.
They left those along with them.
No, they didn't.
They knew they were on a mission.
They didn't bring me a dossier?
Like on their entire origin history plan.
I was going to a job interview after this.
Among them, you'd find 18 silver pieces.
Oh, we're gonna try to go for that without even noticing.
Make a sleight of hand check.
Donnie making friends among the party right away.
I love it.
Also, it's 18 silver pieces.
I don't care if it makes it.
14? 14?
What's everybody's passive perception?
Not I.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
What's your passive perception?
Not I.
16.
10 plus your.
12.
16, yeah.
You too.
You know, let's just grab this one.
Let's just tuck it in right in his pocket.
Do with that what you will.
I thump him on the back of the head with my quarterstaff.
She's like, hey!
Shake my head of disapproval.
Hold on, what's going on?
Birds gotta eat, man.
Don't worry about it.
Birds gotta eat.
Shh.
I should have never told him that's hard.
Yeah.
That's what I can, it's got to be.
Yeah, it does.
That's what I can, it's got to be.
Yeah, it does.
What's the weight on the hand cross pose?
I don't know.
Hey, is there some extra weapons I'd like to get some?
Well, they're doing that.
I go and examine the facial features of each one
and I just gotta shake my head.
Hand cross bow weighs three pounds.
You make like a skin mask.
I don't know.
Great.
Psychotic?
It seriously costs 35 gold pieces.
Oh yeah, because they are very...
There are six hand crossbows
and apparently that's worth way more
than the coins they have on them.
Hey, really quick, you've probably received,
just because I've been part of a couple of campaigns now,
and the wealth never seems to be properly distributed.
It is, though.
It is, you were just never there.
If you don't show up, you don't get stuff.
No, what it is, is they're waiting
until a day that you're not here.
Oh, we're totally working on this.
We have all this gold and silver.
He'd be gone for like three weeks in a row
and then come back and he's like,
I don't have anything.
Where's all my money?
It's like, you weren't here.
We did all this stuff.
I just want to say, I don't know about the leathers.
This guy's like typing everything.
The hand crossbows you can definitely carry.
In order to carry a whole bunch of studded leather armor,
that's gonna be bulky.
Hey, can I get one of those hand crossbows, please?
A backpack.
No, like a holding.
But a backpack, you could probably take one.
I love that.
Hey, can I get one of these hand crossbows?
Yeah.
Cool.
Yeah, there was six of them.
Can I get one of the right hands?
Jesus.
I'm trying to stack that coin.
I'm gonna cast a tangle again.
Stern, that's serial killer trophy.
Well, I go over to the guard
and I'm like looking at his hands,
I'm like bopping my fingers a little bit.
I want his right hand.
But the guard who was helping you in this area?
No, I stopped him.
I stopped him.
I have to stop him.
You can't cut up the victim.
They're gonna think we killed him.
You see in the guard's pouch,
he has a picture of his, presumed his wife,
to my lovely Doriana.
You can tell from the magical photo that she is pregnant.
The guard's wife?
Yeah.
So now.
Roll a d20 card.
Don't mess with family, Danny.
Six.
Six?
You do kind of heal in crossbows on this card, right?
No.
I'm gonna specialize in a modified poison spray
that is just hallucinogens.
And I'm gonna use that every time he gets it online.
Just give him a little spritz.
Stop cutting up people.
Go to sleep.
Can I grab the magical necklace?
Magical necklace?
That was a magic necklace.
Whatever the fuck that was.
I'm doing like the Harry Potter photograph thing.
It's just a picture.
It's a parchment, but it's alive sort of thing.
Try and get back to the point.
That's very, very minor illusion magic.
Well, he works here.
She'll get his stuff.
I think she knows what she looks like.
I'm gonna go back to questioning the guy.
People who can cut up things later.
And while he does that, I start looking at his feet.
Try it.
I'm right?
How many hit points you got?
I might just poison spray him
and just roll a new character, dude.
You did.
You are an unstable individual.
What's your alignment?
Evil, chaotic evil.
That's what that is.
He's doing that.
Can I go here and see if there's a door?
Are there criminal activities?
All right.
So yeah, tell me what all you're doing.
You want to interrogate the guy.
I'm questioning the guy.
And making sure like there's,
I mean, we should also probably make sure
no one else is coming.
Because you heard fighting,
but if none of us get closer, then.
I want to go check down that way for a minute.
Check down that way.
There are some other,
there are, these are doors.
You can tell that there are some other doors
in this area here.
One thing you find,
looking over in this area,
there's another port for us.
That seems to be blocking off some stairs going up.
Yeah, you see.
And these were all shut like before,
because we didn't hear any like.
Yeah, this was like,
as you were being escorted into this area,
this was like securing everything afterwards.
Yeah, so this is,
you think that some,
at least some of these doors lead to other guest rooms.
Yeah, and you can see a number of other adventures
with you.
All right, so you're walking around.
What is Nyxy doing?
She's watching,
see what is happening around her.
Is she helping with the interrogation?
Threatening to melt his face?
Probably.
What's Durgan doing?
Helping with the interrogation.
Do you do anything like last rites,
or people's losses, is that something too?
Like firefighting their corpses?
Maybe we'll wait till they're gone,
and then put some mud on them.
We don't do baptisms for the dead.
We baptize the dead.
We baptize the dead.
The sacred rite of rowing their corpses into the river.
And what's Amnon doing?
I'm gonna go check these part coalesces,
and make sure they're really sealed,
and listen, make sure there's,
make sure this part of that,
our area of operation is secure.
Check, make a perception check for me.
Okay.
You do not hear any sounds of combat from that direction.
All you could hear,
these port coalesces are blocking off the outside,
so you can just hear the rain and thunder from outside.
Looking at the port coalesces,
they look completely safe.
Nice.
Are,
are these guys wet?
Do they come in from outside, or are they inside?
Yeah, you look at their boots,
and they do have some mud on their boots.
Um, some areas, you start sort of working
in some of these other areas.
You see that they are just guest rooms.
And in them,
you find several other corpses.
You recognize them as the people that you think they are.
Or, you know, some of the people that you think they are.
Or, you know, some of the people that you think they are.
Is this dickhead number here?
Cartuchian, or?
Cartuchio?
He is not.
Oh, right.
Carpaccio.
Gaspacho.
I don't think it's Gaspacho.
Are these doors on the far end,
between like other parts of the,
Yeah, you know that, you know, this is,
so you were escorted from the main hall
through that area, into this area.
You know from having gone through this area
that there's like a garden area past this door.
So that's like the most like where they came in from,
is that side of me.
The way over those doors in Casca.
While you, you know, you're kind of searching some rooms,
you're interrogating.
How would you like to do this?
I have several people standing around looking menacing.
He's got to cooperate.
He's got flames coming out of his fingers.
He just, uh, playing with the ear.
No, I just want to be like, I want to like.
I don't need standard questions.
Who sent you?
Why?
Yeah, why did you, why are we talking?
Why are you trying to kill us?
Clearly they were going to try and kill us next
because they were going to ruin the room.
You received private?
You were given a task?
I know you attempted to do that task.
So I know.
Who are you?
Like what organization do you work for?
Make a history check for me.
Make a history check for me.
Can I do it?
Exactly, history.
Yeah, you're participating in the interrogation.
You can always roll history,
like you don't have to be proficient in interrogation.
Uh, same as that.
Nyxy, history check.
Okay.
Ten.
Okay.
Not great.
Nineteen.
Nineteen.
Judging by his general appearance,
especially with the tattoos on his face,
you recognize him as being a member of the Black Tears gang.
Pretty on brand.
Yeah.
Black Tears gang.
I'm going to read and name these guys here.
Yeah.
You know them as like a minor thief, you know,
definitely somebody you've heard of, but not,
they're not in the big leagues.
I'll do much more of my duties.
I'll ask the next question.
Like, does he know who hired them?
Or like,
hopefully you're in charge.
Not these other guys here.
What was, what was your job?
You were hired.
Like, what was the job?
What was the objective?
You had one job.
Was there a certain person you had to make sure was dead?
Or was it just?
Make an intimidation check, I don't know.
Because they're white.
While he does that, I just reach over,
I just put my hand on his right ear.
Twenty.
While he's doing an intimidate with twenty,
I just put my hand on his right ear.
Twenty, and you're threatening his ear.
I love torture.
You do it so well.
They hate everybody.
We were told to kill indiscriminately.
Everyone in the family.
Who's that?
Who's indiscriminately?
Have we met him?
What's your name?
I don't know.
Seven.
It's seven.
It's seven.
Oh my God.
Wow.
There was this nickname.
His name was Lee, and he was indiscriminate.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He just has poor judgment.
I start pooling on the earth just a little bit.
That's all I know.
We were given a task.
They said, kill everybody in the manor on this night,
and they'll pay us.
What more do you need?
That's it.
Where were you hired?
Is there a LinkedIn profile?
Yeah, just trying to.
They hired us a new step.
Which here we know is a town in the north,
and that's kind of a purple light.
So it's another one in the town area.
We don't hear any sounds of fighting anywhere else?
I'm gonna go make sure everything's secure.
I would think we could probably, yeah,
try and go see whoever's in the manor.
I would say every once in a while,
you can maybe hear some tumult coming from
sort of that garden area.
But you know, most of it's gardening.
I think we could move out, take our prisoner with us,
and try and go find the guy whose house this is.
I don't know, maybe Jumanji?
Yes, let's go find Jumanji.
We'll find out.
The lady of the house.
The lady of the house.
Okay, in a second, I'm gonna slip.
I'm gonna slip, like, pervert.
Oh yeah, now the battle's over.
Can I get my stuff, too?
Take a little time to.
Bumper, I want you to make a perception check for me.
Ooh, perception check.
Could you get a perception check?
Could you get a perception check?
21.
21.
So as you're searching some of these other guest rooms,
everybody you find is either dead or one room
is totally empty, where there's nobody in there at all.
You do find a severed hand.
What?
Not a severed hand.
Not a severed hand.
Not that I've ever met anyone.
You find a long sword and caltrops.
You find a healing potion.
And you find, upon one elf's hand,
a pulling attack and not severed hand,
a silver ring worth 15 gold pieces.
Can I pick up the healing potion,
the ring and the caltrops?
And as you sort of leave those areas,
make a perception check for me.
What was that again?
18 gold pieces.
18.
So you see Bumper sort of coming out of those rooms
and sort of working out rings, putting them away.
It's got a new potion on it, though.
Nice.
What's up?
Nice.
I'm happy I just have a new hand crossbow and a dagger.
Got that stuff in my bag.
No daggers on my belt.
Guess I gotta stab somebody.
Okay.
Well, hey, sometimes,
we don't know what a paladin's like.
It can be a little, a little stabby.
That's not my paladin, it's not a clerk.
All right.
You can kill, but you can't take shots.
Yes.
That's exactly, oh my God, that is exactly right.
Yes.
What are you doing?
I'm kinda like creep up to this door and look out.
Sure.
Trying not to get stabbed in the face.
Are you trying to open the door
or are you just trying to listen at the door?
What are you doing?
I'm trying to like, you know, open it a little bit,
hear out, see if there's any banditry or...
Okay.
I'm trying to make a stealth check
and try to open it sneakily and quietly.
You want me to help you?
12.
Do you need assistance?
Hey, whatcha doing?
Hello, fellow students.
Hello.
Oh.
I just don't want to open the door
and get stabbed in the face.
Not for me.
Easy peasy.
I'll go open the doors and, you know,
I'll just have him in front and we go through the door.
Ooh, it's a whole new world.
All right.
Oh, new world.
I don't know what we're coming up.
Bob, yes, where were you interrogating the guy?
You've decided he's tied up.
You've stripped him of his weapon.
Did you strip him of his armor?
Maybe not his armor, but like,
since we tied him up before,
by that point all his weapons isn't like...
Gosh.
So, Thumper, you're kind of opening the door and...
Are we coming in out of here?
Where are we coming from?
You're going into that.
Oh, coming from this door.
This way.
Sorry.
I don't know where we're going.
You'd be in this big open place.
Okay, over here.
Oh, I didn't know this was...
I don't know where we're going.
Yeah, it's full of image.
So, Thumper, you see this large indoor garden
resembles a tropical paradise.
Lush plants and flowering vines hang from the walls
while a slow-moving stream of water
cuts through the center of the room,
falling languidly from north to south through stone drains.
The planters filled with colorful flowers
line the stream, two narrow bridges arched over the water
allowing passage from one side to the other.
Partially submerged in the stream to the north
stands a life-size marble statue
that contains an armored, half-elk woman
holding a rose and wielding a shield.
Would you be holding a shield and wielding a rose?
Holding a rose, wielding a shield.
Did I perceive any paint in the trees?
Yeah, I made a perception check for me.
I'm gonna watch our six.
The reception.
23.
23.
That's a 20.
Big success.
Double bandits.
More banditi.
Oh.
Relax.
You see four of them.
You sort of try to hide behind flowers and stuff
but you notice them right away.
Do they see me?
You also notice as you open the door
they've got crossbows ready at the door
and they see you.
Does anybody have any time limits today?
Okay.
Okay.
I think your number is better furnished here.
Yeah.
Your number is always better.
And also more dices, more things.
I rolled up eight in total.
Who wants to swap initiatives?
That'd be pretty cool.
You can have mine.
What's yours?
Four.
No thank you.
That sounds horrible.
I'm just the only one next to the doorway
and I don't know what he gets.
I'm alive.
Nyxy, what'd you get?
Four.
Yeah, I've rolled a natural one, so.
Treelon, what'd you get?
20.
Yannick, what'd you get?
18.
Durgan, what'd you get?
19.
Thumper, what'd you get?
Eight.
Amnon, what'd you get?
16.
You don't wanna roll a trade?
I'll leave it to her.
Enon.
Okay.
Yes, we can.
Treelon.
It is Treelon's turn.
What would you like to do?
Initiative swap.
You'll have to roll an initiative.
You can swap your initiative.
I'm sorry, do I have to cross the field again?
No, it's okay.
No problem.
Oh, stop.
Yeah.
Oh.
You can go on the other side of the water.
Yeah.
You wanna switch initiatives?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Holy suck.
So you're dashing.
So you don't need to do it by hand or your hands.
You can just have a four-initiative session.
Yeah, where's that skillet?
Oh, I'm just walking.
Because what's your speed?
Is it six?
Yeah, no one was a kangaroo.
That's true.
35 feet is a good five.
Got my dress?
Yeah.
You can move, what, seven feet?
I'm gonna move seven.
I think I can move seven.
What's that?
I moved seven.
Yeah, the criminal background.
And I'm gonna take a swing.
Okay.
Rage.
Don't miss damage.
Can you weapon attacks, use strength advantage
on strength checks, save, not attack.
This is pretty much an interesting question.
Crossbow?
Yes.
Rage blasts in my next turn,
and my attacking force is saved when I begin
to attack in the next direction.
Do you all have crossbows now?
It also can take existence to fortune computers
and you can change it into a sword.
Rage.
Moved, bonus active rage, you have an active, okay.
One D, 10 plus four.
What was that?
I don't know if that shines okay.
Ugh.
14.
14 to hit?
Yeah.
That hits.
Woo.
All right, so what's your,
look at this war hammer background.
What?
The war hammer attack.
Yeah, yeah.
It says what, one D, 10, what's the last one?
Plus four.
So while you're raging, you get an additional plus two.
It's supposed to be D, 10 plus six.
D, 10 plus six.
10.
I'm confused about something.
It says damage one D, 10 plus four,
but under here it says versatile one D, eight.
So the D, 10 is if he's using both hands.
One hand versus two.
One hand.
Oh, okay.
The other thing else I saw was that
the versatile is the higher of the two.
I swapped it on this guy.
Oh, got it, got it.
Okay, that figure most of the time
that's why I was like, that doesn't make sense.
No.
You wielded the duty for less.
Well, yeah, because your guns are just so fucking huge,
you can't, your dexterity is limited.
Yeah.
It's like trying to, how do bodybuilders wipe?
You know, just boom with him.
All we gotta say is, I helped search.
It's a question I've never asked.
Yeah, but he sneaks up when nobody's looking.
I know.
Over here on pockets.
Five bodies.
You missed a hand back there.
But I can see, we're in the room with,
oh, we're in the room, yeah.
Yeah, it's a double door.
I can see in there, but I haven't saw him.
Okay.
I'm just gonna cast here.
Guide you both.
Okay, roll your attack.
Okay.
So I get a 23.
23 head.
All of that beautiful damage.
17.
Ready to go.
It's gonna pull.
That's good.
Got a bolt.
Jesus.
It's the first level style.
It's 4D6, so.
4D6, first level style?
Good God.
Jesus.
What?
What?
Who pulled the last one?
Clarke told us timing.
You melt his face.
Wow.
You know, written in the Lost Ark.
They're gonna be gone by the time it's my turn
with my four.
Any more movement or anything?
Yeah, normally, hitting, guarding,
bolt is the next attack against the advantage.
Advantage, yeah.
Yeah.
So.
Double advantage?
Double.
It is Yannick's turn.
Nice.
So, you know, like you have your cards tied up.
Are you gonna keep a hand on him?
Yeah.
I feel like we need to keep control also.
We had to.
You hogtied him.
Yeah, but he has to walk,
because when we're standing there,
obviously you can't walk if you're hogtied.
He's way up there.
So I gotta put him down or something.
You mean, put him down?
I'm keeping this guy.
You're putting him down now?
You're hitting your bag of holy.
No, I haven't hit my bag of holy yet.
Yet.
Yeah, no bags of holy in the back story.
That's not cool.
Pretty sure I had one.
I came from a rich family who made magic out of it.
Bag of holy.
Your bag's of holy.
I'm gonna keep, I'll keep on.
My grandfather's plus two grades or.
Keep a hold on him.
I mean, I could make a disc that carries my things for me.
I'll just cast guidance on.
If your character's up next, it's anti-murder.
Yeah, I'll cast guidance on him.
Okay.
Gives you an extra D4 for an ability check of your choice.
Okay.
You can roll before or after making your ability check.
I'm gonna move over here.
Yeah, so I can see out the door
and not put anybody in my way here.
Hi.
Pushing him down to the corner.
That guy.
Okay.
I know you guys are still full health.
They have not been damaged.
Well, they will now.
Yannick, what's your passage reception?
16.
Yep.
You can tell that your guard and the scuffle
is trying to break his bones.
What'd you get?
So, it's a plus 48.
For my.
It would be your plus proficiency.
Okay.
So it's 407, and then I'm gonna roll a four for this.
So, 10.
10 misses.
Is it scary?
No.
Damn it.
Yeah.
Is there anything else you'd like to add?
There's some lines I'd like to include.
But if you use your action.
I didn't write a lot of stuff.
Yeah.
He is going to fire his hand crossbow and.
Big sad.
Okay.
The bolt as he hits the trigger falls off.
Yay.
It's a world of one.
So, the other one will attack.
13 to hit.
I don't know, we're class of 16.
I'm gonna miss this.
Meets it beats it.
What's that word, Chica?
I'm gonna use a post-action to pass Hunter's Mark
on the front one.
Okay.
And then I'm going to shoot him in the face with a Paducah.
Hold on, hang on.
Creeped to me by my great uncle.
He was a.
I was out of my pocket.
He was a note-taker.
Because I have no bullets, I beat him to death with it.
It's a great glove.
Starmie can use it, yeah.
Yeah, she, it was scary.
I got a 20 to hit.
20 hits.
10 total.
You do.
Just as you intended, you shoot him right in the face.
Perfect.
He falls.
Would you like to move at all?
Yes.
D and D.
Move.
Shoot.
And move again?
Okay, that's what I.
Of course you can.
Why wouldn't you?
The other way is crazy.
The other game makes sense because three actions
you can move for all three of them.
You know what's right here?
Shoot.
Bullets of fire.
What, like a 120 foot range or something?
Yeah.
That's why I picked it.
I'm like, what's the like fireball,
like 300 or something like that?
Something ridiculous?
Some number that's so high it doesn't matter.
Yeah.
Hoo.
If he had like a mortar.
26.
Yeah, that hits.
Although it would be kind of fun to be on the map
where 360 feet is not enough.
10.
Even range.
You mount his face and you see no more enemies in front of him.
I run the pockets.
And I.
What do I find?
Guys, guys, guys.
Nobody sees me.
We're on the same team.
Hey.
We don't need to like steal from each other.
At least not now.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay, buddy.
Stealing's bad, okay.
In the meantime, I run.
Our president is saying that his compatriots have fallen.
No longer attempting to break through.
Because I was gonna do produce flame
right in front of his face and be like,
I slaughtered hogs for a living, dude.
You're nothing to me.
That was the rest of my turn that I didn't get to finish.
You find them on your pockets, 12 celeries.
And they have the same gear, they have crossbows.
Can he get to all the bodies before anyone else
can get into the ring to help him?
It's like, you know, if we were doing it by turns,
it'd be like, he has the one body.
That's what I was thinking.
No, he's closer in the ring.
Are you divvying up the treasure that you find?
One, two, three, I'll divide it by five.
Unless we agree that we can divide all treasures.
It's pretty good.
Little things like that, little things like that, it's fine.
You have to set.
I don't wanna set the precedent
for when we start finding real shit.
You have to set the precedent with the little things.
And then all of a sudden it's like,
somebody runs in and steals everything
and then they have all this stuff
and nobody else has anything.
Like, that's not.
I am equally sharing everything.
Okay, so we divide it by six.
If everybody is participating.
I mean, I tried and missed, that's participating.
Participating and dividing your spoils.
Yeah.
I'm good now.
I'm not playing a rogue.
We don't really know what kind of paladin you are.
What are the tenets of yours?
Yeah, we have no idea.
That is a little of your job to write both, by the way.
I know, I know.
It's a work in progress.
Yeah.
That's how this thing works.
Well, that's how I think it recently started, too,
was a work in progress.
Hey, I've got some inspiration.
I've got some prophecy, too.
No, you don't.
But, yeah, you're right.
I was thinking that if I mess, make mistakes,
I could just ignore everything.
Yeah, that's the great thing about being
on the ground floor.
All right, I have 12 silver pieces.
I flip two, each member of the board.
Okay.
All right, two silver pieces.
Yay.
And again, you found four hand crossbows, four daggers.
I do want a dagger, though.
I'll take a dagger, add it to my collection of daggers.
I didn't say this before.
It doesn't make them more valuable,
but they do have this ebony pommel.
Ooh.
They're all sort of the same style.
Standard issue for the black tears, for the black tears.
Yeah.
The buttercream game.
The buttercream game.
You guys ever watch that?
Buttercream game?
No.
God, it seems familiar.
There's a staple among them.
Yeah.
Oh, I didn't watch it.
I didn't know it.
I missed that one.
So these guys are more like the hex angels.
Oh, there is one additional thing you find on them.
Yes?
You find a vial of alchemist fire.
That sounds delicious.
Can you problemat me?
Sure.
That sounds delicious.
1992.
Wow.
The vial of alchemist fire.
And not a single person from the cast is known for it.
The buttercream.
Oh, hey.
Oh, who's she?
Stephanie Gees?
I'm not.
Yeah, no.
She's the only one with a picture of it.
Anybody proficient in religion can make a religion example.
My painting stars.
Stephanie Gees.
Cinematic gold.
46 fiddle.
Award-winning author.
I want you to make a nature check for me.
13.
Eight.
23.
Amon, you notice that the statue is of a minor deity.
She was called before.
It's a marker.
Okay, so it's a minor deity,
so she's like under 18, under 16.
She's under 16.
Okay.
But you know her to be Lady Joanne's patron.
You notice that the water in here seems to be
teleported back and forth,
so there's no way for the water to go.
As it flows from north to south,
the water is being teleported back.
Nice.
We got like a lab pool.
A dead.
Still have my dude tied up.
We're still trying to search for survivors
or somebody who knows what's going on for the house.
Mm.
챱 stagnant perception.
And.
Walk.
Four.
A natural one.
I haven't been giving you anything, you know, now.
Oops.
Yeah.
All right, then.
Anything else you'd like to put in this room?
You still have the prison I worked in,
you're keeping them alive, keeping them secure.
Yeah.
You've divvied up the treasure.
That's gotta be, give us some street cred
for when we try and get our empire started.
Is there anything interesting in the flowers?
Yeah.
What's the flowers?
Triumph.
Great, great, yeah.
Sure, send them to jail.
17.
They're all going to be others eventually.
You're kind of looking around, you know,
the flowers are pretty, it's a really well cared for area.
Where we are is that there are flowers.
You do notice,
we're not in the wildlands, right?
We're getting closer to the statue.
We're in civilization.
There are actually flowers.
It looks like you could probably open it.
Oh, I tried to open it.
Good job, well done.
Well done, let's work with you.
No, you open the hidden compartment.
On the inside, you find four healing tokens.
Woo!
Okay.
A scroll of bark skin.
Okay.
One potion of lesser fire resistance.
Okay.
Potion through that.
Okay.
You're going to find a small bronze key.
Woo!
Yes, I am.
I let you guys know that I found it.
It's very nice of you.
It makes you feel like you want a key.
I see part of the team.
Look what I found, guys!
It's a quality.
It sounds really good.
I know, yeah.
Love being part of a team
as they both have their bags full of shit
they've looted off bodies.
I don't.
Yours is full of human body parts.
I don't want to hear it.
I don't know, I just thought we were parts.
It's an ear and an ear.
And an ear.
Part of it.
We want to see.
We can try and duplicate your bark skin scroll.
Expert duplication.
Okay, double.
If you would like more stuff.
Would that make an actual scroll?
Would you copy writing or craft work
produced by yourself or someone else
you've been with and any ability check
you make to produce something?
Yeah, so if you were going through the process
of crafting a spells scroll,
you would be able to do the damage on it.
And how much does that cost?
Maybe it would be the cost of producing
a spells scroll in the kitchen.
It's difficult for what?
Holy shit, what?
How much can you sell them for?
Might be a little cottage industry.
Generally it's half, but something cost 50.
You can sell it for a little.
You have not a really lucrative business model.
Volume, if we get enough volume though.
One thing you notice is sort of looking
around this area including the corpses,
you can hear some shouting from deeper ends
of through the neck doorway.
It's very muffled, you can tell it's
kind of going through a couple doors.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Which way?
This way?
Over here.
The name is hostages.
Okay, yeah, let's go.
This is a great spot.
It's 350.
Okay.
We'll let the big guy go first.
Excellent.
I'm on the rug, I'm on the rug.
All right, so we're like level six by now?
Or what's the?
Yeah.
That's how that works, right?
Each of those guys were like.
It's not like experience,
every second is an experience point, isn't it?
I don't know how it works.
Each room you clear is a whole level.
I think I figured out kind of how they are though.
I think you're going for the
make it church long game, right?
Make it church long.
You weren't making church long properly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's been probably two hours now, apparently.
All mega churches.
Yeah.
Or breaker paladins.
Sorry, I've been out longer than you.
Sorry, I'm out.
Let's eat.
Holy crap, I didn't get to smite anybody.
Well, there's still some more muffle.
I took out two guys with fire to the face.
I think those are the hostages, though.
They're still hostages.
They're empty rooms.
I melted a guy.
Heartbreak, Tamlin.
That's what I was going for.
I killed a guy with a trident.
A barbarian, but you're still a brick.
You're still a trident.
Yeah.
Killing people.
Yeah, I saw that brick.
We didn't even talk to you about that.
You might want to lay low for a while.
Let's save some Tamlin for me.
Dead in the City.
So one thing I would appreciate from each of you,
separate photographs if you care for students.
Some of you have sent me back story stuff,
some of you have not.
If that's something you're interested in,
you can do that.
Even if it's a paragraph.
You have a copy of my character's shape.
Paragraph is all you wanted?
I would say that's a minimum.
Or a page and a half.
Give me something to work with down the line.
I'm working on the book of the line.
Booker.
And if you pick a picture of your character,
send me that.
There you go.
There you go.
Thanks.
I'll figure something out.
I gotta get my,
I forgot one of my spell cards too.
Didn't come in handy this time, but.
That's pretty good.
My speech with animals.
You gotta figure out how to get some stuff.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Where's that?
It tells you everything.
Cause,
they didn't,
I don't know that they have the new spell cards yet.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Yeah.
I don't think they made them.
Yeah.
Are there different spells?
The spells are different.
Yeah, they tweeted some,
but not a bunch though.
Thank you.
Yeah, I looked online,
I'm like,
spell cards.
We're doing this all again?
Go where?
Yeah.
I missed it.
I missed you guys.
Nice to meet you.
Did you see the rest of these?
Does next Sunday work?
Doesn't work for me.
I'm trying to,
I'm trying to trade cards.
You guys are doing it,
but currently I can't work with you.
I'm out of town the 24th through at least the 8th.
But I wouldn't be opposed to working remotely.
Just so I can make sure I get my shares of the wealth.
I work,
but not until,
I don't know,
5.30.
Okay.
All Sundays are equally bad for me.
Correct.
Yeah.
Next Sunday is Father's Day,
if that matters to you.
Same old,
same old for a lot of me.
